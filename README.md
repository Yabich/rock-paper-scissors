# rock paper scissors project
This is a rock paper scissors game, made with pure Python's OpenCV library. It shows if a person does rock, paper or scissors figure and for two players it shows who wins.

Plans for future:
1. Make the game playable, add counter
2. Add scoreboard for one set
3. Add multiplayer
